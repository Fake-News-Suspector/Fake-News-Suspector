I created this lower back pain relief blog to help others live their best lives free from the pain that comes with sciatica and spinal stenosis.

About 6 years ago I learned that extra pressure on my sciatic nerve in my lower back was the cause of my excruciating pain that was keeping me up at night. I would literally fall asleep and wake up 30 minutes later from the sharp pain running down my leg.

I decided to put together this site to act as a resource for all of the treatments that worked for me while also educating people on alternative treatments and additional information about the conditions and what you can do.

If you want to see what I consider to be the best methods and products to help relieve your pain and return you to a normal way of life, check out my homepage.
