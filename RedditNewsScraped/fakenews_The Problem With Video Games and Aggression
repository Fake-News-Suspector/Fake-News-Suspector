As of late there has been a lot of talk about the problem with video games and video games and aggression being linked! Video games linked to aggression have been the talk of the town after every major event such as the one recently in florida!



In other words this is the video game connection to aggression..



There is set to be a white house video game meeting that should spark some conversation on whether or not games and aggression are truly a video game problem 2018 that should be addressed or something that is pivoting from the real issue going on in society!



This meeting on video games is one that has a lot of people frustrated that the people in charge of running our country! Lots of people blame video games for the recent events



The topic is not new and there several discussions such as: video games and the brain, video games and depression, video games and mental health, video games and children...all of which revolve around evidence that has yet to be put forward!



As there is no evidence that video games linked to aggression exist!



So now we deep dive into the topic!
