Cricket is for India what football is for the rest of the world. While Indians take it to the streets, malls and public places with dhol-dhamka, the world has its own ways of celebrating the victory of football matches.

But, in what looks like an insincere attempt at being creative and forgetting to follow discretion, a budget airline from Vietnam took the celebrations a bit too far.

VietAir, a Vietnamese budget airline had an in-flight fashion show with bikini-clad flight attendants. These attendants welcomed home national soccer team that didn't even win their match. As one can clearly see in the video, attendants were seen walking down the aisle, back and fro in a bikini and posing in front of the flyers.

The manager has however apologised for the move, but VietJet is infamous for having its attendants walk in bikinis, basically to attract more customers, which is why the apology looks fraudulent. The team was returning from n Asian tournament in China, at which they lost badly to the team from Uzbekistan.
