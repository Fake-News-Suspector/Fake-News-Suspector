Drunk Man With Epic One-Liners Getting Arrested Is The Funniest Shit You'll See Today

First things first, watch the video and ROFL.

Now watch it again.

What begins like any other arrest video on the Internet, soon spirals into the realm of 'Internet legend'. Just to clear things up, the guy ‘arresting’ the funny man is a bounty hunter. So it’s not like the man is going to jail. He probably owes someone some money and will now have to pay up.

The arrested man looks like a bloke in his 20s, who is probably 'on something' really potent and his safeword is ‘pineapple juice’! Laughing yet? And that’s not the only BDSM references there. He calls the bounty hunter ‘booty hole man’!

He reminds us of a class clown who everyone liked and was always getting in trouble with the teacher. But his heart in the right place, he tells kids to not do drugs!

Hope he got out of trouble.
