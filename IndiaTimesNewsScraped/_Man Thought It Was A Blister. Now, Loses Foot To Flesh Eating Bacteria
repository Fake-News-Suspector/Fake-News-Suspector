Man Thought It Was A Blister. Now, Loses Foot To Flesh Eating Bacteria
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
In a tragic incident, a 26-year-old Raul Reyes woke up with an infection in the foot, and thought it was a blister from an injury at work. The next day the blister was covering his entire foot. "He then visited the clinic thinking it was something minor but he was told that he should get to the emergency room immediately. Then a yellowish mass spread across his right foot," his wife, Joseline, told the Houston Chronicle.

After an X-Ray, the disturbing possibility of a deadly infection came forward, and the doctors had to hurry to stop the bacteria before it entered Raul's bloodstream, which would accelerate the spread of the disease. He was admitted on February 23 at Ben Taub Hospital in Houston. Raul, a day-care teacher is now coming to terms with the ravages of a flesh-eating infection that burrowed into his appendage, reported The Washington Post.

While the doctors reassured that they would try everything they could to keep Raul's foot intact, it was not possible. "Thirty minutes pass and I see the doctor come out," Joseline said. "I was told they tried to get as much bacteria out but they had to amputate his foot to save his life." Reyes may be a victim of necrotizing fasciitis, which is also called a flesh-eating infection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bacteria is commonly acquired via salty or brackish waters through four organisms coming into contact with open wounds or cuts. Doctors believe Reyes contracted the bacteria through an open wound from an ingrown toenail. Houston is on the Gulf of Mexico, though Joseline said she is confused about where her husband might have contracted it.

His family started a GoFundMe campaign to raise $11,000 for the prosthetic, the page says. Doctors told him that he would lose his leg, but four surgeries later, his limb was saved.
