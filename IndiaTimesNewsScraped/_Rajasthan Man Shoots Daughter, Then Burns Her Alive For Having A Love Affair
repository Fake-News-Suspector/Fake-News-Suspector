Investigators said Singh showed his monstrous side for the girl having a love affair with a boy for nearly three years, despite the family's objection.

The family which had objected the relationship had shifted her from the school to a nearby town, but she continued the affair.

Angered by this, Singh asked her to return home earlier this week. Once home, the angry father shot his daughter and with the help of his younger brother and his wife set her on fire.
