Sinkhole Suddenly Opens Up And Gobbles Unlucky Man’s Rs 4.5 Crore Rolls Royce!
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
China is one of the biggest economies in the world and it's no surprise that it’s also home to many millionaires. And since 2014, the country is the biggest market for Rolls Royce, makers of some of the most expensive cars in the world.

The surprise was cunningly hiding under the road, waiting for a Rolls Royce. And one unlucky man was at the receiving end. Here’s a video of the catastrophe.

The incident occurred in Harbin city, the capital of China’s Heilongjiang province. At this point we should probably crack jokes on the infamous Chinese quality. But we’re having conflicting feelings. A great car that costs upwards of Rs 4.5 crores ending up in a giant hole in the ground is heartbreaking. Then again China’s OBOR is basically a long road running across the length of Asia and Europe and if it’s anything like this, then LOL.

Surprisingly, the Rolls Royce was the only casualty and all other cars made their way around it without damage. The driver said he was waiting for the lights to turn green as soon as he set off, the road caved it. He made it safely out of the window of the car.

The car had to be hoisted out using a crane and there are no prizes for guessing that the repair bill is going to run into thousands of dollars.
