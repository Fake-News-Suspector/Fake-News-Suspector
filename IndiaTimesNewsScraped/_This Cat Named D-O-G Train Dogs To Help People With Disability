This Cat Named D-O-G Train Dogs To Help People With Disability
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
We all have heard stories of rivalries between a cat and a dog, but have you ever heard about a cat that trains dogs?

Well, a D-O-G (pronounced “dee-OH-jee”), a fluffy black and white cat plays an important role at Support Dogs, Inc. in St. Louis. According to a report by AP, the group trains dogs for assisting people with mobility-related issues and people with hearing loss.

These dogs who are trained to help people with disability are also required to be comfortable around other types of animals. Therefore, D-O-G becomes a perfect candidate to test the patience of the canine. In a video, we can see how D-O-G is irritating a dog by playing with its tail and its leash.

“We saw that he was completely fearless despite his size and had no issue being around and close to the dogs,” volunteer manager Stephanie McCreary told This Dog’s Life.
