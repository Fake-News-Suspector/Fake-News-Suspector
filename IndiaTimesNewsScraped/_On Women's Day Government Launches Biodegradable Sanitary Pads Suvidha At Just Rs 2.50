“From the average price of Rs 8 a napkin we are bringing down the cost to RS 2.50. These are the first set of biodegradable sanitary napkins to be available in the market. These are much cheaper than pads available in the markets,” Union Minister for chemicals and fertilisers Ananth Kumar said.

The government is introducing the Suvidha pads at a time when there has been an increasing demand from women across the country to waive off the GST on sanitary pads.

According to the National Family Health Survey 2015-16, about 58 percent of women aged between 15 to 24 years use locally prepared napkins, sanitary napkins and tampons. Further, about 78 percent women in urban areas use hygienic methods of protection during menstrual period; only 48 percent women in rural areas have access to clean sanitary napkins.

The introduction of Suvidha pads is expected to help women especially in the rural areas who would not otherwise afford to buy one.

In the recent years, there has been an increased effort to create awareness among rural women towards using sanitary pads.

However, the high price remained a matter of concern for many, which the government aims to reach out to with Suvidha.

It is also worthwhile to note along with this development that the Andhra Pradesh government has promised on the occasion of International Women's Day, that sanitary pads would soon be available at half price.
