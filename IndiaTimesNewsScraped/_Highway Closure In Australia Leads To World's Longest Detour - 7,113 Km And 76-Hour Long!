Highway Closure In Australia Leads To World's Longest Detour - 7,113 Km And 76-Hour Long!
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Australia, the island continent is massive and empty! It has one of the lowest density of human population with only 3 people per square kilometre with most of its population residing on the east coast. The deep interior of the country is barren and empty for the most part and distances between cities can be massive. For example, Perth in the south and Karratha in the north (both in Western Australia) are 1,522 km apart.

But yesterday, after accidents on the two highways connecting the cities, North West Coastal and Great Northern Highway, were both closed to traffic. Anyone who wanted to drive from Perth to Karratha or vice-a-versa was only left with one option – this detour.

That’s a massive 7,113 km long detour that takes 76 hours of non-stop driving!

Taking the boat will probably be quicker.
