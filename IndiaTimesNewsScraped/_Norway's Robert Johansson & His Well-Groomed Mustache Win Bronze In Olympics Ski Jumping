Norway's Robert Johansson & His Well-Groomed Mustache Win Bronze In Olympics Ski Jumping
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Norway's Robert Johansson have become a superstar. No, not because of his incredible bronze-medal winning jumping in the normal hill finals but for something as bizarre as well-groomed moustache. Yes, you read it right!

The 27-year-old's eye-catching facial hair quivered as he flew into third place in the normal hill event, where spectators and even competitors shivered in temperatures that plumbed minus 12 degrees Celsius (10 Fahrenheit) but felt much colder with a fierce wind gusting off the mountain.

The blustery conditions caused numerous delays when the jumpers finally finished well beyond midnight on Saturday night.

Johansson, however, was warmed by the rabid attention on his handlebar moustache.

"I started it two years ago and it's been good for me," he told reporters, smiling, after grabbing the first Olympic medal of his career.

"I started getting compliments for it and just went with it."

Andreas Wellinger of Germany might have won gold to stun reigning double Olympic champion Kamil Stoch, but Twitter users were more obsessed with the curling foliage adorning Johansson's upper lip.

"Norway's Robert Johansson has won the Moustache Games," joked one.
