“Kohli will be the first-ever Dalit woman in Pakistan who becomes a Senator,” a PPP spokesman said.

Born into a peasant family in Thar, as a child Krishna along with her family were held as bonded labours by their landlord for nearly three years.

She was married at the age of 16, when she was still a school student, but unlike most others continued her education after marriage and did her post graduation in sociology.

She entered politics inspired by her brother Veerji Kohli, a noted human rights activist, especially of the marginalized communities in Sindh, and actively worked for the rights of the marginalised communities of Thar.

She hails from the family of the valiant freedom fighter Rooplo Kolhi, who had waged a war against the invading British colonialist forces when they had attacked Sindh from Nagarparkar side in 1857.

Kolhi is the second Hindu woman to be nominated as a Senator in Pakistan. The Hindu woman to become a senator in Pakistan was Ratna Bhagwandas Chawla from the PPP who represented the province of Sindh from 2006 to 2012.
