Turkish Man Live Streams Suicide On Facebook After Daughter Got Engaged Without His Permission
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
A Turkish man, miffed over his daughter's engagement killed himself by shooting in the head while live streaming it on Facebook.

Ayhan Uzun, a resident of Kayseri, a city in the centre of Turkey killed himself after ranting about his family's action.

"Her future father-in-law took my place and without having the right, he approved my daughter's wedding,” he said in the video.

"Nobody said this girl's father is alive. Though I would have waited for my daughter and family to say to me: 'Come, father, be with us.'

"My wife called me and she told me. I said to her why didn't you come to tell me, and she said: 'We cannot make a personal visit to you...'

"Maybe some of you will call this a show. I do not want anybody to go through this thing that I am going through. “I do not want anyone to live what I live,” Uzun said, adding “I will put an end to life with the weapon in hand." People who were watching him on Facebook tried to ask him not to do anything drastic, but he continued his rant. And then on a countdown of three, he pulls the trigger.
