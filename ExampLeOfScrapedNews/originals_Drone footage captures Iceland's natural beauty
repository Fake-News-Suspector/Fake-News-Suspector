Drone footage captures Iceland's natural beauty
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Cinematic drone footage highlights more than a dozen of Iceland’s natural beauty spots in their rawest forms, from the black sand beaches of Reynisfjara to the gallons of water that cascade from the Waterfall of the Gods. Ran Rosenzweig visited multiple locations around Iceland in the sepia-toned period between Sept. 22 and Oct. 13, 2017. This stunning 4K drone footage captures the breathtaking scenes from the Land of Fire and Ice, soaring over geothermal spa locations and endless lava fields. The Israeli-born 40-year-old was left speechless and in awe of the destinations he found himself exploring — and he still has difficulty believing they exist. (Caters News)
