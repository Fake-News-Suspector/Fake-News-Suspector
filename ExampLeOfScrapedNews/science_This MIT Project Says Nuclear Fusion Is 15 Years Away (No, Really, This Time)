This MIT Project Says Nuclear Fusion Is 15 Years Away (No, Really, This Time)
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
In the 1950s, researchers predicted that the world would have nuclear fusion–which uses hydrogen atoms, an incredibly abundant fuel, to provide clean, almost limitless power, while avoiding the hazardous waste problem and catastrophic risk of current nuclear power–within 20 years. By the 1970s, predictions were still at least that far away; the same was true by the 1990s. Now a team at MIT, along with an MIT spin-off company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, says that the technology might finally be within reach. Despite years of false starts, the university and startup believe that they can produce a working pilot plant in 15 years. A difference from the past, they say, is a new type of superconducting
