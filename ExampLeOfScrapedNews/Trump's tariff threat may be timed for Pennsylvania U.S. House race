WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has alarmed the Republican establishment and world leaders by threatening tough steel tariffs, a message that might be meant not just to shake the world trade order but to help defend a congressional seat in Pennsylvania.

Some Republican strategists said Trump's tariff threat appeared to be timed, at least in part, to sway voters in the steel country of Pennsylvania, including its 18th District where Republican Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb are facing off.

In a special election on March 13, the two will vie to replace Republican Tim Murphy, who resigned in October in a sex scandal. If Saccone loses, it would be a blow to Trump, the first loss by Republicans of a seat in the House of Representatives since he took office in January 2017. The results will not affect Republican control of the chamber.

Trump has endorsed Saccone and is scheduled to visit the Pittsburgh area on Saturday for a campaign event. Saccone met Trump on arrival for a similar event in January.

Republican strategist Ford O’Connell said Trump’s stance on steel and aluminum tariffs could help Republicans, not only in southwestern Pennsylvania, but across the industrial Midwest.

"The timing definitely helps Saccone,” O'Connell said.

The 18th District covers steel, farm and coal country on the West Virginia border, as well as well-to-do Pittsburgh suburbs. Trump won the district by nearly 20 points in the November 2016 presidential election, helping him carry the pivotal battleground state.

But in recent political races in other states, Democrats, upset by Trump policies, have been energized to turn out to vote. In the Pennsylvania race, Lamb is rising in the polls and is neck and neck with Saccone, who has said: "I was Trump before Trump was Trump."

Peter Navarro, the White House trade and manufacturing policy director, defended Trump's trade plan on Fox Business Network's "Varney & Co." show on Monday. "Of course, if you go to Ohio or Pennsylvania, or you go to the heartland of American Main Street, there’s universal support," he said.

Trump threatened to impose 25 percent steel and 10 percent aluminum tariffs in an announcement on Thursday, prompting a steep stock sell-off and expressions of concern about a possible trade war from Washington to foreign capitals.

'THIS IS A WINNER'

Establishment Republicans should not be surprised that Trump is following through on his tough-on-trade campaign pledge, said Chris Barron, a pro-Trump Republican strategist.

"If Republicans are going to hold on to the majority in the House, they need to hold on in places like Pennsylvania. This is a winner,” he said, adding the rally on Saturday would be good for Trump, who will get positive feedback from the crowd.

"It's going to be hard to talk the president back from that, because he's going to feel first-hand that support from those grassroots working-class voters," Barron said.

Democrats said the tariff issue would likely be a factor in the 18th District race, but one that would cut two ways.

Pennsylvania Democratic strategist Mike Mikus said: "The issue of steel tariffs is a very popular idea here in western Pennsylvania. However, I don’t believe it will be enough to help Rick Saccone in this election. I don’t view it as a game-changer because the issue has been championed by Democrats for so long.”

Republican strategist Mike DeVanney said tariff rhetoric may help Saccone, but that any boost could be muted in the diverse district.

He added that the president’s comments could backfire. "It’s not without risks in equally energizing Lamb’s base,” DeVanney said. “President Trump is obviously a figure who can energize and divide, depending on who’s listening.”

Trump tweeted: Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November? Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win. Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling?Schiff replied: No, Mr. President. The FBI investigation began when it was discovered that the Russians had secret discussions with your foreign policy advisor about dissemination of stolen Clinton emails.And how can you criticize Obama for not doing more, when you do absolutely nothing? Rep. Schiff asked the perfect question. Why is Trump blaming Obama for not doing enough when he hasn’t done anything? Donald Trump has done literally nothing to punish the Russians and stop them from interfering in future elections. Trump’s tweet was a distraction tactic. When anything goes wrong, or Trump is getting blamed his go-to move is to claim that he inherited the problem from Obama.Trump is trying to argue that he “inherited” the Russia scandal from Obama and that it is really Obama’s fault that Russia interfered to help him win the White House. It is an argument that is ridiculous on its face, and flat-out delusional beneath the surface.If Democrats win back the House, Adam Schiff is going to be in charge of the Russia investigation, and the message that he was sending was that he isn’t going to be played with or distracted. Schiff knows where to look, and the former prosecutor will be zeroing in on the man in the Oval Office to get to the bottom of what happened in the 2016 election.

ATTENTION Americans: The State Department Has Spent NOTHING Of The $120 Million It Was Given To Fight Russian Meddling. Natasha Guzman. =COMMIE REPUBLICANS!!!!!!!!The New York Times reported Sunday that the State Department has spent exactly $0 out of the $120 million it was granted to prevent Russian meddling in the 2018 elections.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who didn’t even want his job and claims he only took it because his wife convinced him to, is responsible for the lack of action. Soon before Trump took office, Congress approved a $60 million budget for the State Department to combat election meddling efforts from Russia and China. After Tillerson spent seven months deciding whether or not the department should take the money, it was ultimately too late to accept the funds because the fiscal year was days away from ending.The department had another $60 million available for use for the next fiscal year. Once again, Tillerson sat on the decision for months five exactly. Last Monday, the department agreed to take $40 million.$0. That is how much money the State Department has spent, out of $120 million available, to investigate and prevent election meddling. If the President wants to demonstrate that he is free from involvement with Russia, he should call for the money to be spent to prevent meddling.Tillerson went into his job as secretary of state with a plan to cut a third of the State Department’s budget and a disdainful attitude toward government in general.The fact that the Trump administration has allowed this to continue is just more proof that they know perfectly well that Russian interference in American elections will probably work in their favor.
