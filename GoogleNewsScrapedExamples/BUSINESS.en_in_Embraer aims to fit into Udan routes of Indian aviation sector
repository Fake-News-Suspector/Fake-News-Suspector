Brazilian Aircraft manufacturer Embraer, which forecasts a whopping market of 1,000 commercial jets for the Asia Pacific region in the 150 seat segment in the coming 20 years, is betting big on the Indian aviation sector.

Embraer, which hitherto known for its swanky private aircraft, wants to fit the gap between 70 seated turboprop and 180 seater jets, suitable for the UDAN routes.

Presenting an alternative for the overcrowding of all the six major airports of the country, Cesar Pereira, vice-president Asia Pacific, Embraer, has said that bringing in more wide bodied jets won't solve the problem. "There must be small aircraft making point to point flights avoiding these six hubs which already take 60% of the traffic," he said.

He added that unlike other BRICS countries, India is the only country that doesn't have a regional fleet.

Embraer, which has only 17 private aircraft in India so far, will soon have more operators opting for the Brazilian aircraft. Cesar said that Air India, Vistara, IndiGo, Spice jet and Jet Airways have shown a keen interest in its E-175 Jets. However, Embraer hopes that the 50 aircraft order by the grounded sub-regional airline from coastal Andhra Pradesh Air Costa is still valid. Cesar said that he hopes that the airliner will recover soon.

Claudio Camelier, Vice President Sales, Middle East and Asia pacific, said that the Indian market is very important of them particularly in support and service side which is offered through two Indian firms offered through six service centres.
