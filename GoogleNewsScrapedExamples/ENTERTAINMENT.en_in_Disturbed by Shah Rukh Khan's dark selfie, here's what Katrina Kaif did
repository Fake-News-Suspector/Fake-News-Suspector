Superstar Shah Rukh Khan's Zero co-star Katrina Kaif is quite disturbed by dark selfie the actor took while stuck in traffic. Hence, concerned Katrina took the charge of fixing the colour and brightness of the actor's photograph.

"Katrina Kaif, extremely disturbed with my last dark selfie, took it upon herself to rectify my photography game. Here is a sample of her amazing love for taking pics and keeping us all so entertained on the sets," Shah Rukh wrote alongside a photograph of himself.

On Wednesday, Shah Rukh tweeted a dark selfie, and wrote: "I took this pic in colour on the way to 'Zero' shoot. It's taken so long in traffic, the colours have faded."
