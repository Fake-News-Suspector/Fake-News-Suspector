Ajay Devgn feels that social media today plays a huge role in deciding a film’s fate.

Ajay Devgn has been donning the cop uniform on the big screen for at least 15 years now. This time, he will be roughing up the bad guys for his upcoming film, Raid. The actor has been spending the last few weeks visiting metros across the country to promote the film. Ajay is of the opinion that it is extremely important to market one’s films today. “Promotions play an important role. Having say that, I don’t like to overhype the promotions for my film. Finally, it is word of mouth that drives the film.”

Ajay feels that social media today plays a huge role in deciding a film’s fate. “We read a lot of negative stories today. These sentiments are fanned on social media, which isn’t even real. Everyone is a critic online. I think we could stop creating problems online if we don’t give them the attention.”
