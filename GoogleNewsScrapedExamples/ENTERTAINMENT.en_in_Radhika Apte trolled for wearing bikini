Radhika Apte trolled for wearing bikini
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Radhika Apte has joined the list of actresses who were trolled for wearing what they want. She posted a photo of herself in a bikini at a beach. However, to a recent daily she has given a befitting reply. "I didn't even know I was being trolled till someone told me. It's ridiculous! Do people expect me to wear a sari on a beach? I don't know them (the trolls), so I don't deal with them," she said. On the work front, she was recently seen in 'Pad Man'. She is presently shooting for 'Bazaar' and 'Sacred Games'.
