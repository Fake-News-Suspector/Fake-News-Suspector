Mumbai: Metal stocks came under heavy selling pressure on Friday after the US imposed tariffs on certain steel and aluminium imports, sparking fears of a global trade war. These worries led to key indices giving up their gains and ending in the red.

The BSE Sensex finished 43 points lower at 33307.14, while the broader NSE Nifty shed 16 points to 10226.85. Among sectoral indices, the BSE metal index was the biggest loser during Friday's session as it slid 1.94 per cent after US President Donald Trump signed two proclamations that imposed tariffs on some steel and aluminium imports.

While Tata Steel was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack as it slid 5 per cent to Rs 605.60, others too ended in the negative territory. SAIL cracked 6.40 per cent, Jindal Steel dropped 5.24 per cent, Nalco dipped 2.19 per cent, NMDC 1.85 per cent, Vedanta 1.59 per cent and Hindalco fell by 1.26 per cent. However, the JSW Steel counter bucked the trend by finishing with marginal gains.

The nervousness was seen more in the last hour of trade. The Sensex, which remained in the green for the better part of the session, was seen heading southwards after hitting a day's high of 33519.49.

The late sell-off saw the 30-share gauge ending at 33307.14, down 44.43 points, or 0.13 per cent. Similarly, the NSE Nifty settled 15.80 points, or 0.15 per cent, down at 10226.85.

This was the second straight week of losses for the benchmark indices.
