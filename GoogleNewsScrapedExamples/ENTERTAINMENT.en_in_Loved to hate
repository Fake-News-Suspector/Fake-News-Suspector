In one scene where Urvashi Rautela is pretending to act, in a film where she was pretending to act, she winks at the camera and says, “And the Oscar goes to….” The film might not get an Oscar, but it definitely deserves a Razzie for the most ridiculous dialogues ever.



Example 1: “Pata nahin tumne mere hoton ko kya rishwat di hai, mujhse zyada tumhare sunte hai.”



Example 2: “Bedroom ho ya boardroom, there is nothing Rishma wouldn’t do to satisfy me.”



And the winner is Example 3: “You also love water. Har insaan ki tarha mera sharir bhi 65 per cent water hai. And you love my body, don’t you?”



Yes, I know, what else was I expecting when the film I went to watch was Hate Story IV? Skin show? Check. Raunchy dance number? Check. Good girl in a salwar suit changing into ridiculously skimpy clothes because she is a bad girl out for revenge? Check. World’s most convoluted storyline ever? Double check. But what I didn’t expect was for a film which had women using their body, sex and sexuality to titillate the audience, apparently for revenge, to end with a message about the number of crimes against women and a message against the evil of “eve teasing”. I mean what would you call a film with a plot that is an excuse for women to appear in skimpy clothes and show off their bodies if not evil?



The film starts with Rautela, who plays Tasha, trying to act angry and betrayed about a compromising picture of her with Vivan Bhatena, who plays Aryan Khurana. I mean you later find out that she was actually trying to “act” angry and betrayed but she failed to convince the audience so badly you wonder how Aryan fell for it. Oh wait, he wouldn’t know bad acting if it hit him in the face.



Anyway, so Aryan’s wife (of course he is married, he is a bad guy!) confronts them — cue for another gem of a dialogue: “Bistar ka chaddar change kiya ja sakta hai lekin bistar mein lipti hui mashuka nahin” (or something along those lines) — and she is accidentally shot by the husband.



This is where we flashback (most of which you’ve already seen in the very jerky opening credits as stills) to how the three got involved in the first place, with Ayran’s younger brother Rajveer (Karan Wahi), who is another incredible piece of work, entering the picture. Just before intermission, Aryan drives away with Tasha in the passenger seat after disposing of his wife Rishma’s (Ihana Dhillon) body. Tasha looks straight at the camera with, what I guess is supposed to be an evil grin, for a very long time, I guess to drive home the point the audience knew anyway. It was all an act.



Of course there is another flashback to further back in the timeline of events. Then there is another flashback to even further back. By the time you find out the who and the why of it all, you are ready to cry uncle.



But you have to give credit where credit is due — Rautela might have taken off some of her clothes (this film could very well be a extended lingerie advertisement), but never all of it, and she never had to have sex — only pretend like she did to get her revenge — and she didn’t even have to kill anyone. Nice. Some of the other women didn’t get away with that though. Well, one’s body is of little consequence when it comes to getting a little revenge, right? The man sitting behind me in the hall seemed to agree, given how kick-happy he was during the film.
