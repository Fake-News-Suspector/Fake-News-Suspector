Some films, within the first few minutes, you know will be a massive waste of time. With a bout of migraine added to the mix. Dil Juunglee — we have no idea why there’s an extra ‘U’ in ‘Juunglee’, but it definitely doesn’t make the film any watchable — tries desperately to be a millennial romance, but is the same ol’ boy-meets-girl-loses-girl-gets-girl story we have been watching ever since we started watching love stories.



Set in Delhi in the first half and London in the second, Dil Juunglee rehashes all the tropes of a romcom, with a plot that’s too hare-brained and a treatment too predictable. A large dose of When Harry Met Sally, a dash of Bridget Jones and a bit of Made of Honor — all the romcoms we enjoy rewatching on Romedy Now — make up Dil Juunglee, which struggles to piece together a coherent story. The biggest problem? The chemistry between its leads, Saqib Saleem and Taapsee Pannu, is ice-cold.



Directed by newcomer Aleya Sen — who managed to conjure up a lot more sizzle between Taapsee and Saqib when she directed them in the music video Tum ho toh lagta hai a few years ago — Dil Juunglee starts off with Koroli Nair (Taapsee), her two besties in tow, eloping with Sumit Uppal (Saqib). Cut to a few months ago, the two meet and fall in love when Sumit lands up in Koroli’s class for some spoken English lessons. But very soon, there’s more biology in play than “English-Vinglish” and the two decide to run away and marry, against the will of both sets of parents.



But poor little rich girl Koroli, who is scared of dying single and struggles to live up to the expectations of her over-achieving dad, soon realises that Sumit — the “head coach” at Gulati’s Gym in Lajpat Nagar II who harbours the dream of becoming a Bolly hero — is only looking at this as a marriage of convenience. They break up.



Seven years later, Koroli is a high-flying corporate honcho in London, while Sumit is a struggling actor who gets by with bit roles in TV shows and B-grade movies. He lands up in London for a shoot, their paths cross and sparks fly, despite he having an actress girlfriend and she a loving fiance. If you’ve watched a couple of romcoms, and even if you haven’t, you know how this will end.



Dil Juunglee may have seemed like a really cool idea on paper — puppy love turning to mature romance, Dilli-flavoured walk and talk giving way to sipping beer by the Thames and philosophising on love and life. On screen, nada.



The first hour is a mish-mash of every Bolly stereotype involving Delhi and Punjabis and Punjabis in Delhi — loud mother to smart-ass friend, mooli ke paranthe to songs that scream out ‘mundeya’ and ‘kudiye’, ‘talli’ and ‘botlan’ in every line. Things pick up somewhat in Half Two, with some nicely done bits — Koroli chasing Sumit dressed as Hanuman through the streets of London will bring on some laughs — but it quickly degenerates into a yawn-fest.



Taapsee is the one bright spot of Dil Juunglee, but she struggles with her sketchy character. It’s also pretty shocking that after playing inspiring women in Pink and Naam Shabana, Taapsee picked up a character that comes across as very needy and seeking male validation.



Saqib, who is otherwise easy-breezy in similar roles, seems oddly out of depth here, especially when he has to play the brooding lover. The rest of the cast put in acts that can be classified as everything from insipid to irritating.



Dil Juunglee is the kind of film you wouldn’t really loathe, but much worse, you don’t really care for. What got our goat? The way they killed Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak’ s Gazab ka hai din for us. Leave the classics alone, guys!
