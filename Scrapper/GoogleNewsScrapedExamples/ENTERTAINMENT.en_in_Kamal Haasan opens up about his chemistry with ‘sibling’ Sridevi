The entire Bollywood and Kollywood film industry was in shock to hear about the sudden demise of superstar Sridevi Boney Kapoor.

“I met Sridevi when she was 15-16 years old. Sometimes in a family, a brother and sister, during Gokul Ashtami or Krishna Ashtami, are dressed as Lord Krishna and Radha. That is what I feel about Sridevi. We were siblings but were made to do romantic things, which we laughed at,” he said. He further added, “It sounds odd that she was like my sister considering that we were one of the most romantic pairs ever. That is what good acting is about.”
