India’s Political Banking System
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
How can India stop crooked businessmen from defrauding its banks? The government thinks the answer lies in making it easier to punish those who cheat and escape overseas. The real problem: India’s largely state-owned banking system takes orders from politicians rather than allocating capital efficiently based on a prudent assessment of risk.

India’s latest banking scandal involves a f lam boyant diamond merchant with global ambitions. In January, 47-year-old Nirav Modi hotfooted it from Mumbai to an unknown destination weeks before investigators accused him of defrauding state-owned Punjab National Bank of $1.8 billion by getting bank officials to issue fraudulent bank guarantees for his business. Mr. Modi says he’s innocent.

For an outraged public, Mr. Modi symbolizes the worst excesses of Indian crony capitalism. Over the past decade he built a glitzy eponymous business. Nirav Modi jewelry stores sprung up in New York (on Madison Avenue), London, Hong Kong, Beijing and New Delhi, among other places. Last year, Forbes valued his fortune at $1.8 billion.

Priyanka Chopra, the crossover Bollywood star of the ABC drama “Quantico,” served as his global brand ambassador. Kate Winslet wore Nirav Modi jewelry to the Oscars. In a Condé Nast profile last year, Mr. Modi spoke of his ambition to be “Asia’s first truly global luxury brand.”

The scandal has embarrassed India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Nirav Modi is not related to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but the coincidence of their shared last name lends itself to social media memes and opposition jibes. More awkwardly for the BJP, the jeweler was part of a group photo of top Indian businessmen with the prime minister at this year’s Davos summit in January.

Stung by criticism, the government has swung into action. Tax authorities raided properties owned by Nirav Modi—as well as his uncle Mehul Choksi, also a jeweler on the lam—and seized gold, diamonds, jewelry and a fleet of luxury cars. A parade of high-profile bankers has appeared before the ominously named Serious Fraud Investigation Office, a government body looking into the alleged crime.

The government has revoked the passports of Messrs. Modi and Choksi and approved a tough new law that would allow authorities to seize the property of fugitive loan defaulters. It also plans to set up a new body to oversee auditors.

All this may look good. But as with much of the Modi government’s approach to economic reforms, it ignores the real problem: State-owned banks, which account for 70% of India’s banking system, are virtually designed to be defrauded by the politically well-connected.

Under the thumb of politicians, and backstopped by a limitless supply of taxpayer money, state-owned banks lack the incentive of private banks to make commercially sound decisions. The Reserve Bank of India estimates that nonperforming assets account for 10.2% of all Indian banking assets. Many economists believe that understates the problem.

The issue dates back nearly 50 years to India’s socialist heyday. In 1969 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi nationalized 14 major private banks—a move ostensibly intended to help the poor, but which also conveniently dried up funding for her political opponents. Since then, most Indian bankers have taken their cues from bureaucrats and their political masters rather than from the market.

India allowed new private banks to begin operating again in 1993, but privatizing inefficient and often corrupt state-owned banks remains out of bounds. At a business summit last month, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley declared that privatization “involves a large political consensus,” and that “Indian political opinion may not find favor with this idea.”

When it comes to banking, Prime Minister Modi is scarcely different from his predecessors. He has frequently corralled state-owned banks to implement decisions that may not make financial sense but are nonetheless politically popular. Since coming to power in 2014, the BJP government has prodded banks to open more than 300 million accounts for poor people.

The so-called Mudra scheme, marketed as an innovative way to help entrepreneurs, essentially shovels cash to small businesses. Over the past year, BJP-ruled state governments in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan have pledged to write off loans to farmers worth about $11.8 billion. Whatever their merits, these programs mainly serve social and political purposes rather than commercial goals.

Unsurprisingly, despite the government injecting more than $23 billion into flailing state-owned banks over the past three years, the stock market shows little confidence in them. The combined market capitalization of India’s 21 state-owned banks is currently less than that of a single private lender, HDFC Bank .

Skeptics of privatization point out that private banks sometimes failed in the decades leading up to bank nationalization. According to Ravi Venkatesan, nonexecutive chairman of the state-owned Bank of Baroda, this view is misguided.

“Privatization does not guarantee good governance,” says Mr. Venkatesan in an email interview. “But it does drastically reduce the influence of politicians and the government, and brings the discipline and agility of the market.”

A government serious about reform would use the Nirav Modi scandal to make the case for banking privatization to the public. Otherwise Indians will have to settle for made-for-TV posturing until the next scam comes along.
