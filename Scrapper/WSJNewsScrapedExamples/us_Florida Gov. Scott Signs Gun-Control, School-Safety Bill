Florida Gov. Scott Signs Gun-Control, School-Safety Bill
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Friday signed into law a bill that includes the first significant gun restrictions in the firearm-friendly state in decades, nearly a month after the deadly school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

Joined in Tallahassee by family members of the 17 people killed in the Feb. 14 massacre, Mr. Scott said he weighed three factors in analyzing the legislation: whether it would improve school safety; provide more funding for mental-health treatment; and keep guns away from people who shouldn’t have them.

“The answer to all three is yes,” he said. “That is why I’m signing the legislation today.”

The measure contains a mix of provisions that pleased no constituency entirely, and liberals and conservatives criticized different elements. Still, the families of those killed had pleaded with lawmakers and the governor to approve the bill as a way to take steps toward improving school security.

After Mr. Scott signed the bill, the National Rifle Association filed a federal lawsuit against the state in the Northern District of Florida seeking to block the law. The organization argued that a provision in the law banning adults under the age of 21 from buying firearms of any kind is an unconstitutional violation of the Second and Fourteenth Amendments.

“This blanket ban violates the fundamental rights of thousands of responsible, law-abiding Florida citizens”—namely, those who have reached the age of 18 but aren’t yet 21, according to the complaint. It also argued that the new legislation infringes on the rights of women between the ages of 18 and 21 who “pose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school shooting.”

Twelve states and Washington, D.C., impose a minimum age of 21 for all handgun sales, while 22 states and the District of Columbia do so for long guns, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Earlier this week, both chambers of the Florida Legislature passed the measure with bipartisan backing, though support came mostly from Republicans.

The bill increases the minimum age to buy a firearm to 21 from 18, with some exceptions, and imposes a three-day waiting period before a buyer can get a gun. It bans the sale of bump stocks—devices that enable semiautomatic rifles to operate like fully automatic weapons. And it creates a new system for law-enforcement officers to ask a court to temporarily bar people deemed a risk from having firearms.

The legislation includes $400 million in funding to bolster mental-health services, fund additional school-resource officers and strengthen the physical security of school buildings.

It also includes a controversial provision that creates a voluntary “guardian” program to arm certain school staff members who complete firearm-safety training and pass other evaluations. Faced with opposition to arming schoolteachers, lawmakers restricted the original plan to exclude staffers who exclusively teach.

At the bill signing, Mr. Scott said he remained opposed to the provision despite the changes. He said he had already spoken with lawmakers about redirecting unused funds from that program to the hiring of additional school police officers.

Lawmakers and Mr. Scott, who is a potential U.S. Senate candidate, faced intense pressure from the NRA to oppose the bill. The organization lauded some aspects of the legislation but vehemently opposed gun-control provisions.

On the other side, the families of all 17 victims killed signed a letter earlier this week urging lawmakers to pass the measure. Before signing the bill Friday, Mr. Scott met with some of them.

“I know there is nothing we could ever do to ease your pain,” Mr. Scott said to the families at the signing ceremony. “But know that through the passage of this legislation, the state of Florida will forever honor the incredible impact their loved ones have had on our state. They will never be forgotten.”
