Kalashnikov, The Makers Of The Iconic AK-47 Assault Rifle, Are Now Making Electric Motorcycles
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
The AK-47 is a global icon. Produced in millions since 1948, it has been used in pretty much every armed conflict ever since. Heck, it even adorns the flag of Mozambique! Now though, Kalashnikov Group, the makers of the legendary assault rifle are making something for peace. Or at least for the peace-keepers.

This:

Kalashnikov

This is an electric motorcycle, which the company showcased at the recent ‘Army-2017’ expo. It doesn't have a name yet and the technical specifications are sparse, but makers claim the bike to have a 150-kilometre range on one charge and having a 15 kW (20 bhp) of maximum power.

That’s pretty close to what a typical 200 cc petrol engined motorcycle produces.

The motorcycle will be put to use at next year’s FIFA World Cup. Not on the field. The streets. The idea is to equip the Moscow Police with 50 of these motorcycles. Later, the makers expect it to be used in bicycle parades, marathons and even nature reserves – all those places where noise and pollution are a concern.

And though it looks rather rudimentary, like all things Russian, we’re sure it will be extremely tough!
