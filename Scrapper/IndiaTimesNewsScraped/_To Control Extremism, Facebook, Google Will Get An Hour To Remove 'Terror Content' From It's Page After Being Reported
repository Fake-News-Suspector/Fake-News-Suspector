To Control Extremism, Facebook, Google Will Get An Hour To Remove 'Terror Content' From It's Page After Being Reported

To keep a vigilance on the harmful data that is being circulated in social media, the European Union has asked online platforms to take down the 'Terror Content' within an hour of it being reported.

Brussels is looking for ways to combat online extremism amid growing alarm about the use of Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other sites to radicalise people to adopt extremism.

The European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, has already signed up a group of US internet giants to a plan to combat web extremism but warned it would consider legislation if the voluntary approach did not work.

"While several platforms have been removing more illegal content than ever before -- showing that self-regulation can work -- we still need to react faster against terrorist propaganda and other illegal content," the commission's vice-president for the Digital Single Market Andrus Ansip said.

This content remains "a serious threat to our citizens' security, safety and fundamental rights," added Ansip, a former Estonian prime minister.

The commission also said that the incumbent companies need to do more to control content that provokes and excites extremism. The companies should monitor it more carefully.

Last month the commission said IT firms removed 70 percent of illegal content notified to them in the preceding few months.

This was compared to 59 percent before May 2017, and 28 percent in the months after the code of conduct was launched in 2016
