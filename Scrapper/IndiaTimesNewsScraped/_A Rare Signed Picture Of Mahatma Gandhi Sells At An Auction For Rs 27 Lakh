A Rare Signed Picture Of Mahatma Gandhi Sells At An Auction For Rs 27 Lakh
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Mahatma Gandhi dedicated his life to the freedom fight of India. Naturally, anything that belonged to him or had his writing on it would fetch a good price if sold today. A signed vintage photo of Mahatma Gandhi, walking alongside Madan Mohan Malaviya, was auctioned for USD 41,806 (equivalent to Rs 27 Lakh) in the United States.

Signed in fountain pen, "M K Gandhi," the rare photo was taken after the second session of India's Round Table Conference in London in September 1931, according to Boston-based RR Auction, reported PTI.

As the delegate acting on behalf of the Indian National Congress, Gandhi attended the second session of the British-organised round table conference, a three-part conference series held in London from 1930 to 1932, with the aim of discussing the ongoing constitutional reforms in India, a media release said.

Malaviya, who had formerly been president of the Congress and played a significant role in the Gandhi-led non-cooperation movement, joined him as a representative advocating for a free India.

The photo dates to a period in which Gandhi, suffering from pain in his right thumb, opted to write with his left hand, a temporary inconvenience that lasted from August 8-December 19, 1931, according to RR Auction.

At the auction, Karl Marx's letter requesting copies of his 'Revelations' from a noted radical editor sold for USD 53,509. Leo Tolstoy letter was written in 1903 offering editorial advice sold for USD 21,450. Claud Monet letter describing the intensity of his artistic process fetched USD 21,128.
