The mushroom was just sprouting when it was spotted, but later grew up to reach a height of 84cm, that's as tall as two-year-old child.

According to local reports, the old man saw the white-capped mushroom emerging from the ground on October 19 and was shocked to see how fast the mushroom had grown two days later.

The giant mushroom has fascinated locals, many of whom are flocking from nearby villages to pray for good fortune.
