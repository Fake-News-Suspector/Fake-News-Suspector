HIV-Positive Man Sentenced To 24 Years For Infecting More Than 30 Women In Italy

An Italian man has been sentenced to 24 years in prison for infecting more than 30 women with the HIV virus, after having deliberately having unprotected sex with them.

Valentino Talluto, a 33-year-old accountant, seduced dozens of women via social networks using a pseudonym Hearty Style.

Police believe he had sex with at least 53 women during that time, passing on the virus to 32 of them.

Other than the women who he had sex with, four others, three male partners of the women and an eight-month-old infant also subsequently contracted the potentially fatal illness.

In the court, his lawyers argued that Talluto's actions were unintentional, but some of the women he had sex with told the court that he had refused to wear condom claiming that he was allergic, or had recently been tested for HIV.

He also denied of being the carrier of the deadly virus after some women who became infected confronted him.

According to reports, Talluto's mother was also an HIV-infected drug addict who died when he was four.
