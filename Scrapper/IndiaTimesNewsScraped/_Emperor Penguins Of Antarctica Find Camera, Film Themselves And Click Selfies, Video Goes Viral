While in Antarctica, one may have been surprised to see this sight - two emperor penguins in Antarctica shooting a short video of themselves.

The penguins after coming across a camera left on the ice. The Australian Antarctic Division posted this 38-second comic clip on its social media channels Thursday. A Person who was on an expedition had placed the camera on the ground near a large emperor penguin colony in Auster Rookery - while visiting the nearby Mawson research station, reported The Washington Post.

The video starts with a few penguins from a low vantage point but a bird comes near and wobbled it over to an angle that focuses on its face. Later, its penguin friend comes over and adjusts itself on to the frame. The two birds are seen chirping and cock their heads inquisitively at the screen, and then perk up and shake their heads and bellies later.

This is not the first time something like this has happened with a penguin. Back in 2013, a Gentoo penguin in Antarctica snapped an epic, open-beaked photo of itself using a GoPro camera from a Canadian cruise company.
