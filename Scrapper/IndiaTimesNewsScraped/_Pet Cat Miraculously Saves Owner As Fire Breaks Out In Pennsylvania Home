Pet Cat Miraculously Saves Owner As Fire Breaks Out In Pennsylvania Home
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Pets are not just companions for humans but are also fiercely loyal to their owners. Sometimes, they even go to the extent of saving their owners' lives.

In Pennsylvania, firefighters have said that a cat saved the lives of its owners, when a fire broke out. The owners were asleep when the fire broke out. The blaze at 1 a.m. Friday apparently started in the attic of the home in McKeesport, about 12 miles south of Pittsburgh.

Deputy Fire Chief Tom Perciavalle told WTAE-TV that the house did not have any smoke alarms, reported AP.

The cat, however, was the alarm as it made sure to wake up the couple. According to reports, the cat came flying into the room. They thought that was unusual and they opened the bathroom door and realised that there was a huge fire.

He said that fortunately the cat was on top of his game and it potentially saved their lives. The interior of the home was destroyed, and the Red Cross helped the family find a place to stay. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
