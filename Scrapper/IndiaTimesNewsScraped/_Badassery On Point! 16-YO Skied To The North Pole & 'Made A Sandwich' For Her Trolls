Badassery On Point! 16-YO Skied To The North Pole & 'Made A Sandwich' For Her Trolls
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
While many kids plan their birthday parties at the age of 16, Jade Hameister accomplished a 37-day long journey to experience one of the most obscure feelings in this world - skiing to the North Pole and skating across Greenland's largest icecap. She is, in fact, the youngest person in the world to achieve that feat.

Jade who was accompanied by her father, her guide Eric Philips and a two-person camera team from National Geographic documented her work in a video which will soon release for the world. Working with her own 220-pound sledge for 373 miles, Jade did all of this without any assistance.

But everything just can't go in the right direction in this internet stricken age. When Jade uploads her video to YouTube from one of TEDx talk, where she talked about following one's dream, trolls comment on it with 'make me a sandwich' and 'you belong in the kitchen.'

So she did just that. Earlier this month when she skied to the north pole and became the youngest person to ever pull off the Polar Hat Trick, she wrote a message for everyone who trolled her.

"I made you a sandwich (ham & cheese)," she wrote. "Now ski 37 days and 600 km to the South Pole and you can eat it."

Well, Jade, that was badass!

In 2016, 14-year-old #JadeHameister set the record for being the youngest person to ski to the North Pole from outside the Last Degree.

In 2018, she did it again -- and she posted this message for all the men who wrote “Make me a sandwich” under her 2016 TEDx talk. pic.twitter.com/10vu0Caur8 — Big Think (@bigthink) January 25, 2018

I love Jade Hameister's snark.

My heart aches that this 16 year old kid is dealing with the same sexist bullshit as the rest of us. If we can't protect her, what's the damn point of all these fights? https://t.co/X9WGpDsrlz — Mika McKinnon (@mikamckinnon) January 26, 2018

Ever since she posted that, Jade has become an internet star where thousands are praising her for her gut and how she served revenge on a silver platter. The world needs to take inspiration from Jade and girls like her who are a walking testament to equality and the sheer will to do things.
