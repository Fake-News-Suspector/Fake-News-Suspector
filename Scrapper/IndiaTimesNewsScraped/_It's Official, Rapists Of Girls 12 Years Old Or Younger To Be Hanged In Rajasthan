It's Official, Rapists Of Girls 12 Years Old Or Younger To Be Hanged In Rajasthan

More and more measures are being taken in states across India for women to get their basic rights and protection. After Madhya Pradesh, now Rajasthan has taken a progressive step towards protecting the girl child from sexual monsters.

The Rajasthan Assembly has unanimously passed a bill that provides for the death sentence to those convicted of raping girls aged 12 years or below. Officials informed that the Rajasthan state government had started preparing for bringing this bill soon after the Madhya Pradesh government had introduced a similar bill in December last year.

Once the bill is passed into law, Rajasthan will become only the second such state, after Madhya Pradesh. The Rajasthan government took the step in view of the rise in crimes against women, including children, in recent times in the state, reported IANS

Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria had said earlier said that various departments of the state government were studying the bill passed by the MP government to prepare the draft. Haryana Chief Minister Manoharlal Khattar has also hinted at bringing a similar law in his state given the increase in the number of rape cases there.
