Man Tries To Burn All Cockroaches At His House, Ends Up Exploding The Entire Building

The term 'pestering' came from the word 'pest', which of course addresses the extreme disgust and annoyance that one feels when they encounter one. Pest control, for these uncalled pests, maybe the solution until people decide to do something about it themselves. Some end up going overboard while trying to commit a genocide of the creepy crawlies, which can backfire.

A man from Australia was so annoyed with the cockroaches crawling all around his house, he came up with a rather extreme solution. He wanted to burn the roaches in the kitchen with an ignited can and an insect spray.

But, as could be predicted with the kind of measures he took, the man ended up blowing up his house as his tools set off an explosion. The explosion damaged the kitchen and walls of the house, but the damage was more to the man himself.

The shrapnel caused lacerations on the man’s head and hand.

Authorities pointed clear instructions on the spray to keep it away from a flame. While there were others present in the house, the man was the only one injured and was rushed to a hospital.
