Doctors Have Just Banned Beef & Burger For US President Donald Trump Who Is Putting On Weight

US President Donald Trump's love affair with junk food is no secret. In fact, President Trump himself has on many occasion bragged about it. His love for McDonald's was even mentioned in the recently released book by Michael Wolff - Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House - where it was stated that "He had a longtime fear of being poisoned, one reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely premade."

Well, Trump may have been forced to say bye-bye to Big Mac for health reasons. According to Bloomberg, President Trump traded cheeseburgers for salads in the diet -- at least some of the time.

At 239 pounds and 6 feet, 3 inches tall, Trump measured just one pound below obese and taking note of this, his doctor, Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson, advised him to eat less fat and carbohydrates and to exercise regularly.

The Sun

According to Newsweek, Trump has reportedly embraced the new menu choices he is being offered and is enjoying his new diet.

It will be interesting to see for how long Mr Trump who ran an entire election campaign regimen, which reportedly included two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and a chocolate milkshake for dinner can stick to the new diet.
