March is Women’s History Month. What started as a single day in California in 1911 has evolved into a national commemoration spanning 31 days. It’s an annual celebration of women from all walks of life: in the arts, in business, and in education; from your sister to your mother to the woman you grew up waving to across the street. Women’s History Month celebrates women’s determination to be dynamic each and every day of the year. For that, women are well overdue to enjoy this moment.

From the 2017 Women’s March to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, women are letting the world know that enough is enough. The reality is that women make 79 cents to every dollar a man makes. That’s the way things have been for a long time, but it doesn’t mean that’s the way they have to stay.
