How a string of giant atoms might bring quantum computers to physics labs More

When it comes to quantum mechanics, I try to avoid writing about purely theoretical results. This is especially true of quantum computing, where, in the not-too-distant past, every researcher would put their names to papers describing a new way to make a quantum computer. Then people started playing with the real thing, and suddenly the theory-side held fewer attractions. But every now and again, one of these ideas makes me mash my hands on the keyboard. Today, it's Rydberg atoms and how to make a quantum computer from them. It's a bit far-fetched, but given the detail of the calculations, it's probably something that will turn up in a couple of years. And when it turns up, it will not be like
