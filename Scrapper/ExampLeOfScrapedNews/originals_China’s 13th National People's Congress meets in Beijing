China’s 13th National People's Congress meets in Beijing
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
The 13th National People’s Congress (NPC) has more than 3,000 delegates and is the world’s largest parliament or legislative assembly.

A plan to end constitutional limits on Xi Jinping’s term as China’s president overshadowed this week’s meeting of the country’s ceremonial legislature. The annual session of the National People’s Congress — used to showcase economic initiatives, plans for social programs and other government work — functions largely as a formal seal of approval for the policies fixed by the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party.

Held at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the NPC session is held at the same time as the annual plenary meetings of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Together the sessions are known as “Lianghui” or “Two Meetings.” (Shutterstock/AP)
