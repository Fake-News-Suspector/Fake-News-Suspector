Women march on International Women's Day
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
Countries around the world mobilized Thursday for International Women’s Day, with Spaniards on an unprecedented strike, France threatening to “name and shame” firms that pay women less than men, and Iraqi women running a shortened “marathon.”

The #MeToo and #TimeUp campaigns that went global with allegations of sexual misconduct in Hollywood galvanized this year’s celebrations amid surging demand from women for respect and equality.

Hundreds of trains were canceled in Spain over the work stoppage, and countless protests in defense of women’s rights were held across the country.

Ten unions demanded gender equality as the 24-hour strike sought to emulate Iceland’s 1975 work stoppage, when women took a day off to demonstrate their vital contribution to the economy and society. (AFP)
