Another snowstorm pounds the Northeast
	 	 	 	 CONTENT 
The second winter storm in a week will continue to dump wet, heavy snow on New England on Thursday, forcing schools to close and leaving hundreds of thousands without power as it promised to slow the morning commute across the region.

A foot of snow and fierce wind gusts of up to 55 miles per hour were expected from eastern New York through northern Maine on Thursday after the storm slammed the region on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said in several watches and warnings.

Up to 2 feet of snow was expected in some inland parts of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and 18 inches was possible in Maine. (Reuters)
